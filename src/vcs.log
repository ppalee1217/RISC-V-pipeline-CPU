Warning-[DBGACC_OPT] Unrecognized -debug_access option
  Option 'v2k' is not a valid -debug_access option, and is being ignored.
  Please recompile using the '-debug_access<+options>' switch and incremental 
  options as required.  Recommended options are '-debug_access' for 
  post-process debug, '-debug_access+class' for testbench debug, and 
  '-debug_access+all' for all debug capabilities.  Refer the VCS user guide 
  for more granular options for debug control under the switch '-debug_access'
  and refer to '-debug_region' for region control.
